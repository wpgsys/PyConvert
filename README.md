## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing **Universal File Converter**, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher.
- **FFmpeg:** Required for video and audio conversions.

### Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the **Universal File Converter** on your system.

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wpgsys/PyConverter.git
cd universal-file-converter
```

#### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Using a virtual environment ensures that your project dependencies are isolated from other Python projects.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS and Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Upgrade `pip`

Ensure that you have the latest version of `pip` to avoid any installation issues.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### 4. Install Required Libraries

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```plaintext
Pillow==10.0.0
ttkbootstrap==1.10.1
moviepy==1.0.3
pydub==0.25.1
```

Install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 5. Install FFmpeg

Both **MoviePy** and **pydub** rely on **FFmpeg** for processing videos and audio files. You need to install FFmpeg on your system and ensure it's added to your system's PATH.

   - Under **System Variables**, find and select the **Path** variable, then click **Edit**.
   - Click **New** and add the path to FFmpeg's `bin` folder, e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`.
   - Click **OK** to save changes.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open **Command Prompt** and run:
     ```bash
